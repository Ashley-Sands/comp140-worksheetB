### Part A
For my Arduino project I would like to create a pancake cooking/flipping simulator. 
The player will be in control of 2 frying pans and 2 hobs, a jug and a whisk. 
The frying pans will be use to flip the pancakes, the hobs to control the cooking temperature,
the jug to pour the mix and a whisk to mix the batter.

The aim will be for the player to make a pancake mixture using the whisk and then pour the mixture into the frying pans using the jug.
The player will then have to cook and flip as many pancakes as they can without burning or even worse setting fire to any.
The more velocity the user applies to the pan the higher the pancake will go and cause it to do more flips.
When the player runs out of pancake mixture, they will have to make a new one and repeat.

If the player burns too many pancakes it will be game over or if any catch fire it will be instant game over.
The player will be scored on how many pancakes they manage to successfully cook and amount flips they achieve 
also the user will be punished when both pans are empty.

The game will consist of 3 modes standard, extreme and time attack

#### Standard
The player will have control of the cooking temperature, using the hobs.

#### Extreme
The player will have no control of the cooking temperature and it will gradually increase over time.

#### Time attack
Same as standard except the user will have to cook as many pancakes as they can over a period of time.
